## Shallow Copy and Deep Copy


| ***Shallow Copy***                                                                            | ***Deep Copy***                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| stores the references of objects to the original memory address.                              | stores copies of the object's value.                                                         |
| Shallow Copy reflects changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.           | Deep copy doesn't reflect changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.      |
| Shallow Copy stores the copy of the original object and points the references to the objects. | Deep copy stores the copy of the original object and recursively copies the objects as well. |
