## ___const and constexpr___

### `const`

- **Meaning**: Declares a variable whose value **cannot be changed after initialization**.
    
- **Evaluation Time**: Value is **constant at runtime**, but **not necessarily known at compile time**.
    
- **Usage**: Useful to protect values from modification.

### `constexpr`

- **Meaning**: Implies that the value is a **constant and must be known at compile time**.
    
- **Evaluation Time**: Must be evaluated at **compile time**.
    
- **Usage**: Used when a compile-time constant is required (e.g., array bounds, template parameters).
