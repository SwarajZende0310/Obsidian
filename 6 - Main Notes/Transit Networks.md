## Transit Networks

When [[ISP]] and content provider are not in the same network Transit Networks are used to reach the content provider and carry the traffic between them.

Also called ___Backbone networks___ because carry traffic between 2 endpoints.

But as

2. consolidation of content in handful large content providers
Transit networks are only used as backup.
