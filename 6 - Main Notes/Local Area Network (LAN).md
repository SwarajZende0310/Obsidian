	- mostly each computer talks to an __Access point(AP), wireless router or base station__ which relays packets inside network and to internet
	- ___Mesh Network___ : nearby packets relaying messages to one another. it also has some special nodes handling traffic in the network. Used where deploying connectivity is cumbersome
	- Popular Standard for WLAN := ___IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)___ {11 Mbps = 802.11b __to__ 7 Gbps = 802.11ad} 
2. __Wired LAN__ : common physical modes of transmission are copper, coaxial cable and optical fiber. ___IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)___
